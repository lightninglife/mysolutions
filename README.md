<center><h1>My takeaways from these 6 questions challenge - Written on Saturday Sep 26th, 2020</h1></center>

  First and foremost, I'd like to appreciate Bob and the hiring team who put these challenges together. Not only I see these as a path to a promising career, but I use them as a paradigm for me to test my problem solving and development skills. Please note, I had no prior study in coding or development. Everthhing I put together in this challenge is mainly based on my prior knowledge and rearch on different blogs and online source.

  Secondly, I'd like to point out how I overcame obstacles in terms of mental challeges in these 4 days challenges ( Thursday I was off, so I'd like to count as a little less than 2 full days). I kicked off this challenges with confidence and intiatives to complete it by the end of Thursday. I went through the first 4 questoins with ease. However, Q5 and Q6 gave me quite a lot of hassales. There were times when I questions my capabilities and perseverance to resolve the problems. It took me a whole night on Thurday to ultimately figure out a simply solution to deal with Q5, which strengthened my belief to overcome Q6 at the end of the day.
In terms of Q6, I was simply bombbarded by choosing right solutions out of tons of ideas. Finally, I was able to put togher a if loop inside a for to deal with it. Over these 4 days, I went though ups and downs mentally and realized how resilience and belief can make us stronger and better on a daily basis.
