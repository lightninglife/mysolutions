<center><h1>My takeaway from these 6 questions challenge</h1></center>
<p>
  First and foremost, I'd like to appreciate Bob and the hiring team who put these challenges together. Not only I see these as a path to a promising career, but I use them as a paradigm for me to test my problem solving and development skills. Please note, I had no prior study in coding or development. Everthhing I put together in this challenge is mainly based on my prior knowledge and rearch on different blogs and online source.

  Secondly, I'd like to point out how I overcame obstacles in terms of mental challeges in these 4 days challenges ( Thursday I was off, so I'd like to count as a little less than 2 full days)
